# IteratorPattern

Note
--------------
The Iterator design pattern provides a way to sequentially access the elements of an aggregate independent of the implementation of the aggregate and independent of the implementation of the iteration algorithm. In other words when the Iterator design pattern is used with an aggregate clients are independent of the specific type of aggregate and the specific type of iteration used on that aggregate. The implementation of the aggregate or the implementation of the iteration could change without affecting the client.
